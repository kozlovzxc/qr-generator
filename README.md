# QR Generator APP & API

## Installation

```
yarn && (cd apps/app-platforms && yarn)
```

> We need to run another yarn exactly inside app-platforms folder, 
because of [weird expo behavior](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/23c303619072e0e6587d26c4185874ffc6467da1/packages/expo/AppEntry.js#L3).
For some reason, launcher is searching for relative to itself path ☹️
